                    The Tamil Information Centre (TIC) Digital Archive is an independent and authoritative 
                    repository dedicated to the collection, preservation, and dissemination of historical,
                     cultural, and human rights documentation relating to Tamil-speaking people in Sri Lanka.
                </p>

                <div class="content-main">
                    <p>
                        Established in 1979 by Tamil activists based in the United Kingdom, the Tamil Information 
                        Centre has, for over four decades, played a pioneering role in the systematic documentation 
                        of first-hand, authentic, and verifiable information. From its early operations in London 
                        and Tamil Nadu, TIC emerged as one of the earliest and most professionally committed research
                         and documentation organisations focused on the lived realities, historical experiences, 
                         and human rights conditions of Tamil-speaking communities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The archive reflects TIC’s principled commitment to human rights grounded in justice, 
                        equality, and respect for fundamental freedoms. TIC does not promote any particular
                         political solution for Sri Lanka; rather, it maintains a neutral and rights-based approach,
                          guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other internationally recognised human rights instruments.
                    </p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p>
                            Over the years, TIC researchers and contributors undertook their work under
                             extremely challenging and often dangerous conditions, facing threats from military 
                             forces and armed groups in Sri Lanka and India. Despite these risks, they demonstrated 
                             exceptional dedication in collecting, safeguarding, and preserving critical records.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The TIC Digital Archive contains a wide range of primary source materials, including affidavits, 
                        habeas corpus applications, official and unofficial documents, correspondence from detainees 
                        and political prisoners, eye-witness testimonies, reports from conflict zones, photographs, 
                        and audio-visual recordings of interviews and speeches. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through its extensive global network, TIC has collaborated with governmental and 
                        non-governmental organisations, legal professionals, and human rights defenders. Accuracy, 
                        integrity, and accountability form the foundation of the archive.
                    </p>

                    <div class="legacy-section">
                        <p>
                            The TIC Digital Archive is an extension of this legacy and a commitment to its continuation. 
                            It stands as both a historical record and a living resource for research, education, 
                            public engagement, and intergenerational memory.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                     <p>
                        At this crucial stage in the development of the TIC Digital Archive, as the organisation carries 
                        forward the long-standing legacy established by its pioneers, supporters, and the wider Tamil-speaking community, 
                        the public launch of these collections represents both a milestone and a responsibility. This moment is also one of remembrance. 
                        The archive honours the memory and lifelong contributions of the founders and pioneers of the Tamil Information Centre, 
                        including the late<b> Mr. Kanthasamy</b>, 
                        the late<b> Mr. Varadakumar</b>, and the late <b>Fr. James Pathinathar</b>, as well as many others whose commitment, sacrifice, and vision laid the foundations for this work. Their journeys,
                         principles, and dedication continue to guide the mission of TIC and inspire the preservation of these records for generations to come.
